#
# Blog Pagination
# There are 2 predefined index files for paginating the blog posts, `grid` and `horizontal`, with `horizontal` being the
# default. To switch between them just copy the one you want and make it the index.
#
# Horizontal does the full width post, with images on opposite sides.
# Grid is the 2-up grid. If you switch to grid make sure you have paginate set to a multiple of 2
#
paginate: 4
paginate_path: "/blog/page:num/"

#
# Variable Flows
# We have a number of variables that are overridable by more specific instances, meaning...
#   - Setting it as a param on an include (when used within an include file)
#   - Setting it on a page overrides the layout
#   - Setting it on a layout overrides the site
#   - The setting on the site is used as a fallback
#
# This means _we_ can't set this as part of the defaults because that overrides the page setting, which is the most
# specific, and wouldn't allow fallback to the layout or site. HOWEVER, _users of the theme_ are welcome to add their
# own settings to the defaults.
#
# Most of these flows include a debug table to show the flow and the final result. Set this to true to display them.
#
debug: false

#
# Sidebar Variables
# Used for determining the location (or lack there of) of the sidebar, and which file we use for the content
# This uses the variable flow described above to determine the final variable
#
sidebar:
  location: "right"
  file: "default"

#
# Custom Collections
#
collections:
  projects:
    output: true

#
# Globally enable/disable comments
# This is the global override, so if this is false what you do in the collections won't matter.
# If you want comments you still need to pick a provider and add the embed code in the includes/comments.liquid file
# and then probably make sure the comments variable is set in the defaults, or the front matter
#
comments: true

#
# Site defaults
