# Dopetrope-Jekyll-Theme

Another Jekyll Theme based on [Dopetrope][dopeTrope] by [HTML5 UP][html5up].

## Todo Next
- Specify sidebar status as a layout/page variable?
  - left, right, none
    - default > base
    - landing is basically just base/default
    - content/default gets sidebar variable left, right, none  

- Nav as data
  - should those data files really be under i18n?
  - where do we draw the line between data and strings?
  - if it's in a data file it probably doesn't need a i18n

- Projects collection

- Horizontal blog post option on the homepage to just show one

- Finish chunking out the footer

- Better fake images than the blurred
